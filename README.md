##Project No: 01,
#Project Name: Employee Presence Insights

I did this project when I completed my Google Data Analytics Professional Course. 
I got the data from one of my mentor's own research from a company. 

In this project I have created the dashoard for the HR and Admin personel so that they could easily 
1) indentify the employees Presence and Absent
2) See the employees Presence in the Office and and the Work from Home 
3) HR can see the trend when the Employees present in the Office or Work from Home On a particular time. 
4) HR can see the Individual Presence and Absent
5) See the Leave Performnance
