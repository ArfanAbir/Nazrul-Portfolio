<h1>Project Name: Employee Presence Insights</h1>

<p>I did this project when I completed my Google Data Analytics Professional Course. 
I got the data from one of my mentor's own research from a company. I have created this project using Power BI

In this project I have created the dashoard for the HR and Admin personel so that they could easily 
1) indentify the employees Presence and Absent
2) See the employees Presence in the Office and and the Work from Home 
3) HR can see the trend when the Employees present in the Office or Work from Home On a particular time. 
4) HR can see the Individual Presence and Absent
5) See the Leave Performnance </p>

<h1>Project Name: IT Product Sales Insights</h1>

This project was my assignment. I have created this project as the second assignment of the <b>Data Analytics Course </b> 
I have completed this project using <b>MYSQL SERVER</b> and <b>POWER BI</b> tools.
This project for Sales Manager or The person who working with sales and sales data. So Sales Manager can easily 
1) Find the Total Revenue,
2) Find the Sales Quantity
3) Find the Top 5 products by Revenue
4) Find the Top 5 Sales Market
5)Revenue by Market
6) Sales by Market
7) Can see the Yearly Revenue Trend Line and the Monthly Trend Line

<h1>Project Name:Indian City Home Price Predicition </h1>

This data science project series walks through step by step process of how to build a real estate price prediction website. We will first build a model using sklearn and linear regression using banglore home prices dataset from kaggle.com. Second step would be to write a python flask server that uses the saved model to serve http requests. Third component is the website built in html, css and javascript that allows user to enter home square ft area, bedrooms etc and it will call python flask server to retrieve the predicted price. During model building we will cover almost all data science concepts such as data load and cleaning, outlier detection and removal, feature engineering, dimensionality reduction, gridsearchcv for hyperparameter tunning, k fold cross validation etc. Technology and tools wise this project covers,

1. Python
2. Numpy and Pandas for data cleaning
3. Matplotlib for data visualization
4. Sklearn for model building
5. Jupyter notebook, visual studio code and pycharm as IDE
6. Python flask for http server
7. HTML/CSS/Javascript for UI

<h1>Project Name: Sonar Rock vs Mine Prediction Project </h1>

<p>Linear and logistic regression models in machine learning mark most beginnersâ€™ first steps into the world of machine learning. Whether you want to understand the effect of IQ and education on earnings or analyze how smoking cigarettes and drinking coffee are related to mortality, all you need is to understand the concepts of linear and logistic regression. Be it the popular linear and logistic regression models or the less mainstream lasso and ridge regression models that use regularization methods; regression models are ubiquitous. So is the need to get exposure to diverse regression projects to understand the business use cases. </p>

<h1>Project Name: Diabetes Prediction with Support Vector Machine  </h1>

<p>Support vector machine (SVM) is a popular classification algorithm. This tutorial covers some theory first and then goes over python coding to solve iris flower classification problem using svm and sklearn library. We also cover different parameters such as gamma, regularization and how to fine tune svm classifier using these parameters. Basically the way support vector machine works is it draws a hyper plane in n dimension space such that it maximizes  the margin between classification groups.</p>
